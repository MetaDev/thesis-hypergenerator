add random polygons in sample search space
change postion_x , position_y to vector
children is a vector as well and should be part of the search space
no seperate sampling for distributions


save paren child hierarchy in samples

save generated samples in data frame to save space

train different models on data

implement search space in pymc3 using 1 model for the parent child structure and when sampling build new model based on this model
these new models are cached in map based on their structure, such that each different model only has to be build once
