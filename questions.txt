mention the affine transformation of gaussian mixtures as a way to reuse previously trained distributions

In learning not only the finding of optimum should be encouraged (by the log likelihood) but also expressiveness
should be promoted in the learning algorithm, that's why an important optimisation would be to additionally reward
data points based on their difference from previously used data points in the learning algorithm
any distance metric could be used for this
