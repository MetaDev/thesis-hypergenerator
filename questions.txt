done
---------
use of poisson disk sampling

regression works

infinite gauss

set up tests to evaluate training

still to do
-------------------------

evaluation metrics:

for the generator  (to select between consecutive runs)

- expressiveness
             weighted emperical variance

eenvoudige use-case -> ad-hoc evaluatie, overlap van correcte search space aen gemoddeleerde serach space

complexe case emperische analyse -> verzameling punten

- performance,  fitness mean and variance
compare over n samples between brute force en model

for training itself (to select hyperparameters)

-MSE between x,y for regression
-MSE between x and it's likelyhood for weighted sampling

evaluation models
------------------
extract info from neufert and combine with pattern language examples to create 3 scenes
with different constraints, tree hierarchies

implement retraining
implement MCMC sampling of truncuated gmms

for literature:
writing methodology
write related work
